# Horieson-HTML-CSS-Refactor

## Description

My motivation for the project was that I wanted to prove to myself that I could successfully implement Semantic HTML into the project I've made, so I built a project that had it's code rewritten in Semantic HTML making it a lot more legable. The code had a lot of div elements where their should've been header, section, article, and footer elements. From making this project I've learned that I'm more capable then I previously thought at implementing Semantic HTML.




## Usage

The screenshot of the webpage is below. It has the same look as the webpage from the Index.HTML file from the first module challenge folder in the class repo. However it has been rewritten in Semantic HTML to make it look more legable for a outside viewer:
